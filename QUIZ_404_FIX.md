# ðŸ”§ Quiz 404 Error - FIXED!

## Problem

When clicking "Take Quiz" buttons, getting 404 errors because:
1. Quiz pages weren't in navigation (MkDocs didn't build them)
2. JavaScript paths were incorrect
3. Script loading was in wrong location

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Quizzes to Navigation (`mkdocs.yml`)

```yaml
- Assessments: 
    - Overview: assessments.md
    - Python Basics Quiz: quizzes/python-basics.md
    - NumPy Quiz: quizzes/numpy.md
```

**Why:** MkDocs only builds pages that are in the navigation. Without this, the quiz pages weren't being generated.

### 2. Fixed Script Paths in Quiz Pages

**Before:**
```html
<script src="python-basics-data.js"></script>
```

**After:**
```html
<script src="../quizzes/python-basics-data.js"></script>
<script src="../js/quiz-system.js"></script>
```

**Why:** Relative paths need to account for the directory structure. Quiz pages are at `/quizzes/`, so need `../` to go up to `/docs/`.

### 3. Removed Global Quiz System JS

Removed from `mkdocs.yml` global scripts, now loaded per-page.

**Why:** Only quiz pages need the quiz system, so load it only where needed.

### 4. Added Script to Assessments Page

Added at the top of `assessments.md`:
```html
<script src="js/quiz-system.js"></script>
```

**Why:** Assessments page uses QuizManager for progress tracking.

## Files Changed

- âœ… `mkdocs.yml` - Added quiz pages to navigation
- âœ… `docs/quizzes/python-basics.md` - Fixed script paths
- âœ… `docs/quizzes/numpy.md` - Fixed script paths  
- âœ… `docs/assessments.md` - Added script, removed duplicate

## Testing

After rebuilding (Ctrl+C and restart `mkdocs serve`):

1. âœ… Navigate to Assessments page
2. âœ… Click "Take Quiz" for Python Basics
3. âœ… Quiz should load correctly
4. âœ… Click "Take Quiz" for NumPy
5. âœ… Quiz should load correctly

## Quick Test Commands

```cmd
cd c:\Users\yonas\Documents\ICPAC\python-ml-gha-workshop

# Stop current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)

# Start fresh
mkdocs serve
```

Then visit:
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/ai-ml-climate-workshop/assessments/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/ai-ml-climate-workshop/quizzes/python-basics/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/ai-ml-climate-workshop/quizzes/numpy/

## Directory Structure (Clarified)

```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ js/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ extra.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ quiz-system.js           # Quiz engine
â”œâ”€â”€ quizzes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ python-basics-data.js    # Quiz data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ python-basics.md         # Quiz page (loads quiz-system.js)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ numpy-data.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ numpy.md
â””â”€â”€ assessments.md               # Overview (loads quiz-system.js)
```

## Path Reference

When a page is at `/quizzes/python-basics/`:
- `../js/quiz-system.js` â†’ goes to `/js/quiz-system.js` âœ…
- `../quizzes/python-basics-data.js` â†’ goes to `/quizzes/python-basics-data.js` âœ…

When a page is at `/assessments/`:
- `js/quiz-system.js` â†’ goes to `/js/quiz-system.js` âœ…

## Status

ðŸŸ¢ **FIXED** - All paths corrected and navigation updated!

## Next Steps

1. Stop your current `mkdocs serve`
2. Restart it to rebuild with new navigation
3. Test all quiz links
4. If working, commit and deploy!
