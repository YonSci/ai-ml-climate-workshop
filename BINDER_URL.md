## üîç Troubleshooting

If you still get "Could not resolve ref" error:

1. **Verify repository is public:**
   - Go to https://github.com/YonSci/ai-ml-climate-workshop
   - Check Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Repository visibility
   - It should say "Public"

2. **Check that files are pushed:**
   - Verify `environment.yml` exists in the root directory
   - Verify `runtime.txt` exists in the root directory
   - Verify `postBuild` exists in the root directory

3. **Clear Binder cache:**
   - Sometimes Binder caches old builds
   - Wait a few minutes and try again
   - Or try: `https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/YonSci/ai-ml-climate-workshop/main` (using 'main' instead of 'HEAD')

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. Make sure your repository is public on GitHub
2. Push all the changes (environment.yml, runtime.txt, etc.)
3. Use the correct URL: `https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/YonSci/ai-ml-climate-workshop/HEAD`
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for the first build
