# üìö Training on Python and AI/ML for Climate Prediction

## Python & AI/ML for Meteorology & Climate Science in the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA)

Welcome! This foundational training session is organized in partnership with the **UK Met Office** and is supported through the **Pan-African Seasonal Systems East Africa (PASS-EA) project** under the **WISER Africa program**, funded by the **United Kingdom Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO)**.

The primary objective is to strengthen the capacity of **National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs)** from 11 countries across the GHA to produce and deliver reliable weather and climate forecasts that safeguard lives and livelihoods.
