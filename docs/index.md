# 📚 Training on Python and AI/ML for Climate Prediction

## Python & AI/ML for Meteorology & Climate Science in the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA)

Welcome! This foundational training session is organized in partnership with the **UK Met Office** and is supported through the **Pan-African Seasonal Systems East Africa (PASS-EA) project** under the **WISER Africa program**, funded by the **United Kingdom Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO)**.

The primary objective is to strengthen the capacity of **National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs)** from 11 countries across the GHA to produce and deliver reliable weather and climate forecasts that safeguard lives and livelihoods.

| Details | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Duration** | 20–31 October 2025 (Two Weeks) |
| **Focus** | Seasonal Prediction Science, Ensemble Systems, AI/ML Introduction |
| **Format** | Online lectures combined with non-synchronous assignments. Designed to be **interactive and hands-on** using Jupyter Notebooks. |
| **Target Audience** | Forecasters and researchers from 11 GHA NMHSs. |
| **Prerequisites** | Basic Python knowledge is helpful but not strictly required. |

## 🚀 Learning Goals

Participants will gain comprehensive knowledge and practical skills in:

* Seasonal prediction science and evaluation of dynamical ensemble systems.
* Climate data analysis and visualization relevant to the East African climate.
* Model Output Statistics (MOS), forecast verification, bias correction, and calibration techniques, including the use of **Machine Learning (ML)**.
* The procedure for generating probabilistic objective seasonal forecasts using ICPAC’s High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems.


## 🤝 Partners and Support

This initiative represents the first step in a one-year engagement, enabling participants to consolidate their learning ahead of the three GHACOF meetings in 2026.
