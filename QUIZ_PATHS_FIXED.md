# ✅ All Quiz Paths Fixed!

## Final Fixes Applied

### Problem
The "Take Quiz" buttons on the Assessments page were using relative paths that resolved incorrectly:
- `quizzes/python-basics/` → became `/assessments/quizzes/python-basics/` ❌
- Should be `/quizzes/python-basics/` ✅

### Solution
Added `../` to go up one directory level:
- `../quizzes/python-basics/` → resolves to `/quizzes/python-basics/` ✅

---

## Complete Path Reference

### From `/assessments/` page:
```html
<!-- Links to quiz pages -->
<a href="../quizzes/python-basics/">  ✅ Correct
<a href="../quizzes/numpy/">          ✅ Correct

<!-- Script loading -->
<script src="js/quiz-system.js">      ✅ Correct (from root)
```

### From `/quizzes/python-basics/` page:
```html
<!-- Script loading -->
<script src="../quizzes/python-basics-data.js">  ✅ Correct
<script src="../js/quiz-system.js">              ✅ Correct
```

### From `/quizzes/numpy/` page:
```html
<!-- Script loading -->
<script src="../quizzes/numpy-data.js">  ✅ Correct
<script src="../js/quiz-system.js">      ✅ Correct
```
