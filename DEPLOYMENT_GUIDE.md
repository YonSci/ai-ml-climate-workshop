## üéØ Step-by-Step Deployment

### **Step 1: Configure GitHub Pages Settings**

**IMPORTANT:** Do this BEFORE pushing your changes!

1. Go to your repository settings:
   ```
   https://github.com/YonSci/ai-ml-climate-workshop/settings/pages
   ```

2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source:** Select **"GitHub Actions"**
   - (NOT "Deploy from a branch")

3. Click **Save**

### **Step 2: Commit and Push All Changes**

Run these commands:

```cmd
cd c:\Users\yonas\Documents\ICPAC\python-ml-gha-workshop

git add .
git commit -m "Fix Binder config and add GitHub Actions workflow for docs deployment"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 3: Monitor GitHub Actions**

1. Go to the Actions tab:
   ```
   https://github.com/YonSci/ai-ml-climate-workshop/actions
   ```

2. You should see a workflow run starting called "Deploy MkDocs to GitHub Pages"

3. Click on it to watch the progress (takes ~2-3 minutes)

4. Both "build" and "deploy" jobs should succeed ‚úÖ

### **Step 4: Verify Documentation Deployment**

After the workflow completes successfully:

1. Visit your documentation site:
   ```
   https://yonsci.github.io/ai-ml-climate-workshop/
   ```

2. It should load with your updated content! üéâ

### **Step 5: Test Binder**

1. Visit the Binder URL:
   ```
   https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/YonSci/ai-ml-climate-workshop/HEAD
   ```

2. Wait 5-10 minutes for first build (Binder builds from scratch)

3. Once built, Jupyter should launch successfully ‚úÖ

4. Test by opening a notebook and running:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd
   import xarray as xr
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   print("All packages loaded successfully!")
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development & Testing

### Test Documentation Locally

```cmd
cd c:\Users\yonas\Documents\ICPAC\python-ml-gha-workshop

# Install docs dependencies
pip install -r docs-requirements.txt

# Serve locally (with live reload)
mkdocs serve

# Or just build
mkdocs build
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to preview.

### Test Binder Environment Locally

```cmd
cd c:\Users\yonas\Documents\ICPAC\python-ml-gha-workshop

# Create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate it
conda activate climate-workshop

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter lab
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions Fails

**Check workflow logs:**
```
https://github.com/YonSci/ai-ml-climate-workshop/actions
```

**Common fixes:**
- Ensure Python 3.10 is specified in workflow
- Verify all plugins are in `docs-requirements.txt`
- Test `mkdocs build` locally first

### Binder Build Fails

**Check build logs:**
- Click "Show logs" during Binder build
- Look for package conflicts or missing dependencies

**Common fixes:**
- Verify `environment.yml` syntax is correct
- Ensure all packages exist on conda-forge
- Test locally: `conda env create -f environment.yml`

### GitHub Pages Not Updating

**Fixes:**
1. Verify Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
2. Check workflow completed successfully
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for CDN propagation
